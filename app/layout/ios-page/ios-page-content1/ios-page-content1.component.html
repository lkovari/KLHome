<p>I started to learn IOS. iPhone development in winter 2011. I invested some money into a Mac mini. My developer machine is not the fastest model as it has only a 2.3Ghz i5 processor with 8GB RAM memory. Once I will upgrade the HDD. to an SSD, because currently the machine's speed bottlenecks is the relatively long access time to hard drive.</p>
