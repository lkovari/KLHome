  <p class="txt">I grew up next to the northeastern hills of Hungary, a small border town in <a href="https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén/@48.1084905,19.9695768,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x473f5715770e6fd5:0x100c4290c1e1050!8m2!3d48.2939401!4d20.6934113">county Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen.</a> My original profession was not the software development, but after I'm finished the secondary school I corrected this mistake. :-) I was interested in the microelectronic circuit like how the radio, digital clock works, So I learned microelectronics in an industrial school. My favourite theme was the digital technics. At those times I dealt with to build of basic electronic circuits with discrete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits" target="_self">74xx integral circuits</a>. I also planned a wiring diagram and PCB. of a digital quartz clock, (wiring diagram and PCB.)&nbsp;&nbsp;developed the circuit of the clock timing for a quartz based oscillator dividing the frequency&nbsp;1Mhz to&nbsp;the base 1Hz (time base) which was the input&nbsp;of the counting circuit. Later my interest&nbsp;turned to the computer sciences, first I was interested in the hardware, later in the software development.&nbsp;</p>
