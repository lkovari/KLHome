<div>
<p>Date and Time Picker Compoent</p>
<p>My first component was an Analog clock component. After I make a date selector component, when I made of that, I melted those into one component, Date & Time picker component.</p>
See below the Calculatror's UI. screenshots<br><br>
<span class="images">
      <img class="img-fluid" *ngFor="let imagePath of imagePathArray"
           [src]=imagePath>
    </span>
</div>
