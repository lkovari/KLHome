                This language was the first programming language what I started to learn .. My teacher was Ádám Pethő who wrote more books
                about IBM. PC. Assembler and MASM. At that time all files with pure natural assembly I compiled with MASM
                6.11 to link Link.exe and to made com file with exe2bin One day when I asked too much questions from Ádám
                Pethő I got an asm file from him named BIOS.ASM which was a BIG treasure at that time.

        <div>Some application what I made</div>
        <div class="masm-stuffs">
            <li>NumConv converts values between numerical systems (NUMCONV.ASM)</li>
            <li>RealDtTm shows and sets the real time clock date and time (REALDTTM.ASM)</li>
            <li>Anthem plays the Hungarian National Anthem in the background with PC speaker (ANTHEM.ASM)</li>
            <li>CMRam reads and setup the CMOS RAM (CMRAM.ASM)</li>
            <li>VGACRT setups the VGA CRT M6811 chip which controls the monitor screen refresh etc. (VGACRT.ASM)</li>
            <li>Maker: simple demo (MAKER.ASM)</li>
            <li>Prime prime number generator with file handling /reading and writing/ (PRIME.ASM)</li>
            <li>Fs file search with recursive back-tracking algorythm (FS.ASM)</li>
            <li>Slow after the program runs stay resident under 1Ch interrupts, monitors the keyboard buffer and to Ctrl-left
                Shift slows down the computer and Ctrl- right Shift increases the speed of the computer. (SLOW.ASM)</li>
            <li>PCINFO display gives internal information about your PC for example, st game ports, printer ports, DOS. version
                (made 1987) RS232 cards, etc. (PCINFO.ASM)</li>
            <li>MS memory Spy displays the physical memory size with test. This little program contains a converter between numerical
                systems (MS.ASM)</li>
            <p class="masm-publications">I had some publication in Computer Panorama Magazine in July 1992, Feb 1995, Aug 1995</p>
